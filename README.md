# Overview

RecipeManager is currently a simple recipe book program that allows users to create and save recipes. This project is still in the beginning stages
of development. Currently, the program has a very simple UI and only allows for creating and saving recipes to a text file.

The purpose for developing RecipeManager is to create an online platform to support saving and sharing family recipes with loved ones,
as well as to help prevent the loss of beloved family meals whose recipes have been lost to spilled coffee and hungry family dogs.
